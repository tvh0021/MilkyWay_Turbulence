# Turbulence in the Milky Way traced by young stars

Repository storing scripts used to analyze the motion of young stars in the Orion, Ophiuchus, Perseus, and Taurus star-forming regions to understand the impact of turbulence on their evolutionary history.

Scripts in this repository were used to obtain results for two papers:

1. [Measuring turbulence with young stars in the orion complex](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abd8c9) - **Ha, Trung** et al. 2021.
2. [Turbulence in Milky Way Star-Forming Regions Traced by Young Stars and Gas](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac76bf/pdf) - **Ha, Trung** et al. 2022.
